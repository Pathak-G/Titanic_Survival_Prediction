Titanic Survival Prediction ðŸš¢

This project uses the famous Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival based on features such as age, gender, class, and more. Implemented machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, this project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation to optimize accuracy. The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.
